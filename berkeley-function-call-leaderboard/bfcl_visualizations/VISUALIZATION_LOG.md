### Summary
Created interactive visualizations for BFCL Jupiter report findings with ocean theme and collaborative tone.

### Visualizations Created

1. **fan_results_comparison.py**
   - Comprehensive bar chart showing all 5 interventions across 5 BFCL categories
   - Shows systematic testing methodology with error bars
   - Highlights zero_output intervention as the winner in dark turquoise

2. **primary_improvements.py**
   - Focused chart on irrelevance and live_irrelevance improvements
   - Includes Cohen's d annotations (1.521 and 1.936)
   - Shows dramatic improvement in restraint capability

3. **behavioral_change.py**
   - Before/after visualization showing 557.8 â†’ 705.4 empty response improvement
   - Makes the behavioral shift concrete and tangible
   - Stacked bar chart with transformation arrow
